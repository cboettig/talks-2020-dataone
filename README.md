### Abstract

Ecological Forecasting is constrained by our ability to accurately model complex phenomena. I explore our capacity to accurately forecast sudden shifts in common ecological and environmental climate models that may contain tipping points or "ghost attractors." I illustrate how black-box modeling and forecasting approaches, including common machine learning algorithms, can fail dramatically in these scenarios. I further illustrate that even access to the underlying process model is not sufficient to predict the tipping point. In the second phase of this work, I present possible strategies for dealing with the immense uncertainty created by these dynamics. Drawing on methods of decision theory, I illustrate how an adaptive manager can avoid catastrophic outcomes despite limited forecast potential of such scenarios.
